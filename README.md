# Automated-Cleanroom-Safety-Monitoring-System
● The system provides accurate and consistent PPE detection using deep learning. It identifies PPE items with high precision across different industries, proving its effectiveness in real-world situations.

● Automated compliance monitoring greatly reduces human effort and error. The system’s continuous operation and objective decision-making help maintain strict safety
standards.

● Strong detection accuracy in both controlled and unpredictable environments validatesrobustness Cleanrooms offer uniform conditions, while construction sites introduce complexity — yet the system performs reliably in both.

● Real-time inference makes the solution suitable for actual deployment.The frame-by-frame detection remains stable, ensuring that violations are flagged immediately without delay.

● Roboflow’s UI enhances clarity and understanding of model performance.Users can view detection outputs, metrics, and evaluation graphs in an organized, user-friendly
format.

● The project meets its core objectives of accuracy, transparency, safety, and scalability. It successfully delivers automated PPE detection with measurable performance and strong generalization.
